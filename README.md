# Pay Track

My first attempt at iOS & Android apps with Flutter SDK and Firebase backend. 

- Firebase Authenication with Google Sign In.

## What I've Learned

- Flutter SDK is by far the FASTEST compilation time and the app feels much snappier and efficient than NativeScript
- My CLI isn't crashing non-stop from Node memory issues
